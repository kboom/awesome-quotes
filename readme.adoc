===== Scale comes from simplicity.

===== Successful abstractions are the simple ones.

Simple ideas are actually much more likely to be used because of adoption and being able to grow. Simple ideas must fit inside your brain. __MapReduce__ can be one example. 

===== The data always outlives code.

===== Design your data model for the sake of your domain model, not your domain model for the sake of your data model.

===== Constraints enforce elegant design and can give rise to its better properties. The more constraints the more one frees one's self.

===== Having a language that allows you to do anything is not an advantage, it is a liability. You have to find the heart and essence and build on top of that.

===== Software is built not like architecture.
In architecture you can or build buildings from smaller buildings. In software you create software from smaller software and there are no boundaries. This is why the simple ideas are so important - they can bubble up to the top level of the design. Best example might be map reduce. Building architecture has natural scale - a human being. It is designed for a human scale and this is why it impresses us. For software there is no such thing. A human brain may be a limit - can we fit the idea in our brain? Having too much stuff in your brains slows you down and makes you prone to errors.

===== We are far to easily impressed and imprisoned by the concept of size.
Smallness has virtues we should insist on. We should not assume growth without bounds. Economy of scale so much engrained in us but does not apply in software. It does not get cheaper with size.
* How much work does the developers do on things accidental as opposed to essential? Look at how many people work on this code, it has to be special!

===== Avoid cargo-cult programming.

In software there is a diseconomy of scale the more people you have the more problems you will get - cargo cult programming.

===== All code is technical debt, some just have more interest rate.

===== Dead code may be not so dead at some point and be zombie causing trouble.

===== Architecture is like garden - you can grow things but you have to cut other things down.

===== The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.

===== Software becomes an artifact of group intelligence. A design must be organized according to the structure of communication within the organization like convey law states.

===== Data systems amplify the data they hold whereas microservices conceal the data they hold.

===== Beware the cycle of data inadequacy, this is why a real data system is needed.
